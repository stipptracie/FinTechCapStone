## Description
---
In this project, we aim to create an NFT marketplace decentralized application (dapp) for the auction of digital assets using smart contracts, solidity and streamlit.

## Goals
---

In recent years, there has been an ever increasing interest in NFTs - As an example, one NFT which was just an image of a column written in New York Times sold for $560,000 in a matter of days. Observing such keen interest in the demand and sale of NFTs as well as the expanding market for digital assets, we felt it would be a great idea to launch our very own MINT Auction Marketplace. 

MINT's goal is to support local and emerging artists and provide them a fast and efficient FinTech platform to register their work and sell them through an auction-based marketplace allowing them to connect with collectors all over the world through a decentralized network.

Our NFT auction marketplace provides:
1. A platform that connects artists and collectors through blockchain technology with complete transparency. It holds asset/token/deed that is to be auctioned using ERC721 standards.
2. Ability to place bids in auctions, over a decentralized network with following functions and features: </br>
>
        - ability to participate in an English auction whereby bid prices keep increasing over the duration of the auction.
        - ability to monitor the auction process (start bid, bid price, highest bidder etc.)
        - ability to view the frequency of each bidder
        - safe and secure transfer of NFT ownership upon auction completion
        - safe and secure transfer of funds upon auction completion
        - refund of funds to bidders that did not get not lucky
3. Works with digital assests stored over an established and secure file storage system (IPFS - Pinata)
5. MINT does not charge any fees or retain any of the profits from the NFT sales hence providing a free of cost platform for the artists. As opposed to OpenSea, who charge a chunky one-time registration fee to list each NFT as well as recurring fees.

## Development and Technologies
---

Our NFT marketplace is build using the following technologies: 
* Solidity (smart contracts)
* Remix IDE
* Streamlit (frontend)
* MetaMask (wallet)
* Decentralized Blockchain Network (Ganache)
* Pinata
* Python

### Libraries Used
* os
* json
* requests
* eth_account
* eth_typing
* web3
* pathlib
* dotenv
* streamlit
* dataclasses
* typing
* openzeppelin (ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable, Counters)
